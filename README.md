# Pombe_PROseq
# this repository contains scripts used for the alignment and manipulation of precision run on sequencing data. 
# The scripts contained in the folder ScriptsBooth_et_al_2018 were used in the preparation of a manuscript entitled:
# "Cdk9 regulates a promoter-proximal checkpoint to modulate RNA Polymerase II elongation rate in fission yeast"
# Almost all of the scripts contained within the ScriptsBooth_et_al_2018 folder depend on an older version of the BigWig R package (developed by Andre Martins). Since this package does not exist on Andre's github, this version of the package is included in the BigWig_Rpackage folder. 
# Wave calling scripts were derived from polymerase wave calling scripts located here: https://github.com/dankoc/groHMM
# Wave calling scripts depend on a more recent version of the bigWig R package which can be downloaded here: https://github.com/andrelmartins/bigWig
