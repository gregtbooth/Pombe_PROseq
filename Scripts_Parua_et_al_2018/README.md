#Scripts_Parua_et_al_2018
# this repository contains scripts used for the alignment and manipulation of precision run on sequencing data. 
# The scripts contained in the folder Scripts_Parua_et_al_2018 were used in the preparation of a manuscript entitled: "A Cdk9-PP1 switch regulates the elongation-termination transition of RNA polymerase II".
# Many of the scripts contained within this folder overlap with those contained in Scripts_Booth_et_al_2018 as the analysis were prepared and performed in parallel.

# Folder composition

# scripts:  contains subfolders for analyses that were performed on data from different batches of experiments (from either 10-16-2016 or 11-28-17)

# bigWig: contains all of the bigWig formatted processed data files for experiments from the two batches of experiments. These include combined and separated biological replicate files.

# countData: contains tables with normalization factors for each sample and output files with count data for all genes produced from some of the included scripts. 

# PROcap: contains bigWig and bedgraph formatted PRO-cap data for S. pombe, generated in 2014 for use in a previous publication (PMID: 27197211). Also contains scripts for calling observed TSSs from PRO-cap data

# pombeInfo: Contains various filtered gene lists used in different analyses.  Also contains a mappability track, which is required for several analyses and some other info for S. pombe.
